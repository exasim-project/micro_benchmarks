# Micro Benchmarks
A collection of OpenFOAM cases to benchmark in the exasim project

# Usage
All micro benchmarks are stored in subfolders, the assets subfolder 
contains several yaml files describing scaling benchmark setups. It 
is recommended to use [OBR](https://github.com/hpsim/OBR) to setup the cases,
to avoid setting up the test matrix manually.
